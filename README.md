# About

These are software related projects that I have completed so far for the [Nand2tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) (part 1 and 2) on Coursera

These projects were made using Python and they include:

### Nand2Tetris (part 1)
- **Project 6**:  An assembler that converts an assembly language code (known as Hack assembly) into binary language that the computer system (Hack computer) can understand
### Nand2Tetrist (part 2)
- **Project 7**: A VM translator that translates a stack based virtual machine language into Hack assembly language, the functionality of the translator is only limited to translating arithmetic and memory commands
- **Project 8**: Continuation of project 7 which adds more functionality to the VM translator such as branching and function commands
- **Project 9**: I decided to make a simple GUI calculator application using a programming language known as "Jack" which was made specifically for this course.
- **Project 10**: A syntax analyzer for a VM language that parses a VM code and breaks it down into tokens which are presented as an XML file
